Algorithm:

Input to the algorithm:

Direction(angle), length and iteration for drawing the Koch curve .
Output of the algorithm
Displaying the Koch Curve.
Data Variables
oldx, oldy : are static float coordinates for the vertex of triangle.
dir
: stores the angle of line segment.
len
: stores the length of line segment.
iter
: stores the number of iterations performed on triangle to produce th koch curve.
dirRad : calculates radians of angle using dir.
newX, newY : calculates new vertex coordinates for cuvre using oldx and oldy by
performing cosine and sine operations on dirRad.
Algorithm
1. Start
2. oldx=-0.7, oldy=0.5;
3. input dir, len and iter
4. dirRad = 0.0174533 * dir;
5. newX = oldx + len * cos(dirRad);
6. newY = oldy + len * sin(dirRad);
7. if (iter==0) { oldx = newX, oldy = newY; }
else{ decrement iter;
drawkoch(dir, len, iter) with dir as 60, -120 and 60 degrees; }
8. goto step no 7
9. Stop.
Output: Display koch curve.
